						<p class="about-block__text  about-block__text--trade">Increasing prosperity in our lives can be
							accomplished by having the right
							frame of mind. The truth is, our thoughts are very powerful. <br />
							They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from our physical health to our social
							behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”

							If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the power of thought in a
							positive way has the ability to create great change in our lives, including our financial well-being and
							prosperity. But how? How do we take something as intangible as thoughts, and manifest them into a physical
							reality?

							We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money. Prosperity is a
							mindset, a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering this train of thought is not
							easy, but it is simple enough if we keep working on it consistently.

							Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more prosperity into
							your life:

							Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to express heartfelt
							gratitude for the good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of these blessings down each
							day. This helps to put your focus in the right direction — on abundance, not lack.

							Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am” statements such as “I
							am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements down and repeat them nightly before bed. Over time,
							this will implant these thoughts into your subconscious mind, and you will begin to naturally believe
							them.

							Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish to achieve, and
							then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the same way affirmations do. Our
							subconscious will fill with images of prosperity, and eventually these subconscious “truths” will manifest
							in the physical. “See” yourself as being prosperous, and you will become so.

							Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be one of your
							affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell yourself you can earn
							more. Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and you will gain the confidence needed to reach
							higher than you ever imagined you could. If you believe you can do it, you are more likely to take the
							risks associated with people who are highly successful. Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take
							risks and aim higher.

							Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like. Even if you can
							only afford to put a few dollars into your account every month, it will begin to build up and attract more
							money.

							Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such that we lend more
							power and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack will create more lack. Focusing on
							wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?

							Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day. But over time,
							with consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want. Once you master this power of
							thought, there are truly no limits to what you can create!

						<p class="about-block__text about-block__text--commerce">Successful businesses have many things in common,
							today we’ll look at the big
							‘R’ of recognition and how a digital advertising network may help. <br />

							Recognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a crowded room at a party. Both walk to the far
							side of the room, one of them slips through the crowd easily and unnoticed as they reach the far side. The
							second person takes much longer to reach the far side because they are engaged in conversations along the
							way as they continue to meet acquaintances and friends during their path. Which type of person would you
							like to model your business after?

							Your business is in a continual battle for your customers’ recognition whether you know it or not. If you
							happen to be fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with very few competitors, that will not last for
							long. You need your business to be at the forefront of your client’s minds so that when they require your
							products or services, you are the go-to people.

							Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name and logo out there and keeping it there is a
							must. This lets clients know that you are “still around” and in business. Frequency is a good way to
							achieve the “stand out factor” in recognition. I am reminded of both television and radio ads I had heard
							of in the past. They run continually with a catch phrase or musical jingle over and over again on the
							radio or television until you are absolutely sick of hearing it. You also cannot get it out of your head.
							Although this type of advertising is expensive, it can be very effective, and the recognition factor is
							quite high. Television and radio can reach a large audience, and they are broad in their appeal. In a
							brief sentence, you are paying to market to both those that are your potential customers and a large
							segment of those who are not now and probably never will be your customers.

							There are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is to define your target market demographic,
							and invest your marketing funds into the locations that will best be seen by them.

							Another factor to consider is “can I market myself in a place where I will stand out from my competition,
							or where my competition does not have a presence?” Why would you market yourself in a flyer or newspaper
							right beside your competition and risk blending into a crowd, and ultimately being ignored? Another issue
							to look at is diversification. As the saying goes, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you look
							at your advertising budget for the year, try to find the affordable solutions that will continue to reap
							during the full year of your advertising budget. An expensive radio or television promotion may give short
							term gains for that weekend sale, but what about the rest of the year? Your clients may end up with the
							impression of where did they go, I haven’t seen or heard anything about them for so long.

							Don’t always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep your eyes and ears open for the latest and
							greatest ways to market your business. With the costs of technology coming down dramatically new options
							such as digital advertising on LCD and Plasma screens are becoming more and more affordable, and the paper
							billboards and posters becoming a thing of the past. With the flexibility, and curb appeal of full color
							and motion video footage with computer generated graphics available to you, this is an option you don’t
							want to pass by without a good look. Ultimately, recognition is required if you want to get people “in the
							door” of your business (or on your website for the new e-businesses). This is going to cost you money,
							time and effort up front any way that you look at it, but if you have successfully reached your target
							market, the payoffs will be worth it.
